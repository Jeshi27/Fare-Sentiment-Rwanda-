# Fare-Sentiment-Rwanda

This project analyzes public sentiment toward Rwanda's transition to distance-based transport fares using machine learning and natural language processing.

## Problem Statement

Rwanda recently implemented a distance-based fare system for public transportation. This project aims to evaluate public opinion on this policy change using sentiment analysis of social media posts, news comments, or survey responses.

## Objectives

- Collect and clean relevant public opinion data
- Analyze sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)
- Visualize findings to inform policymakers and the public

## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, NLTK or TextBlob
- Jupyter Notebook or Python script
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Project Structure
## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
2.  Install dependencies:
3. Run the script or Jupyter notebook:*or*
Open `notebooks/analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Lab/Notebook

## Sample Output
